      "Sugarscape is an agent-based model that simulates the behavioral characteristics of a group of agents submitted to several predefined rules. This artificially inteligent model was first presented by Joshua M. Epstein & Robert Axtell in their book *Growing Artificial Societies*. This model was considered the first large scale agent model. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Sugarscape model consists of three basic elements: the environment (a 51x51 cell grid, where every cell can contain different amounts of sugar or spice), the agents (who inhabit the environment), and the rules that define the behavior of the agents with each other and with the environment. \n",
      "\n",
      "SugarScape simulation therefore can be seen as a metaphor for resources and inhabitants forming societies in an artificial world and the effects of social dynamics such as evolution, birth rates, death rates, population growth, inheritance on populations, social interaction, etc. can be studied.\n",

      "In case the agent can't do any of these two functions, it will try to move to a place where trading with another agent can take place. For this to be possible the agent has to have energy enough and can only trade with agents of a different tribe.\n",

      "After analyzing the SugarScape model submitted to the rules and parameters we defined, we could make the following obsevations:\n",
      "\n",
      "At first the population of agents in the environment is stable (it does not increase or decrease in a significant way). However, as the number of steps increases we can also observe that the number of agents in the environment also increases, due to the fact that the agents are constantly reproducing and the goods in the environment are constantly regenerating whenever the environment is about to run out of goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the help of the Gini Index and the Lorenze Curve, we could observe that as the population increases, the distibution of goods among the agents in the environment becomes more unequal; the inequality increases as the population grows.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the environment we can also observe that, due to the fact that each agent gives priority to sexual reproduction when deciding where to move, and considering that agents can only reproduce with agents that belong to their same tribe, agents will segregate in the environment into tribes. Consecuently, certain places in the world are mostly occupied by a specific tribe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we could observe certain signs of evolution. Considering that the higher an agent's metabolism rate is, the faster it runs out of energy and dies, the surviving agents have mostly low metabolism rates. This same event happens with the agent's vision range. The agents with higher vision ranges are the ones surviving in the end because they are able to look for goods and other agents farther away in the environment.\n",
